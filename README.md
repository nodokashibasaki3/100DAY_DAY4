# Focus Tracker – Automatic Task Logger

A minimal productivity tool that helps you stay on task by **automatically capturing the app or browser tab you're working in**. No need to manually enter what you're doing — just click **"Add Task"**, and let the app do the rest.

## What It Does

- One-click task tracking — just press **Add Task**
- Automatically fetches the **active app or browser tab**
- Uses **OpenAI API** to generate a **smart, descriptive title** for each task
- Prevents mindless tab switching and forgetting what you were doing
- Helps build focus and intention by logging actual activity

## Example

Suppose you're on a tab with a Zoom meeting, or coding in VSCode. When you hit **Add Task**, the app:

1. Detects the active window or tab (e.g. `Zoom Meeting`, `main.py - VSCode`)
2. Sends context to OpenAI to generate a concise, descriptive task name like:
   - `Team Sync: Marketing Updates`
   - `Bugfixing File Upload in React`

## Features

- Instant task logging from current app/browser
- AI-powered task naming (via OpenAI API)
- History log of tasks you've worked on
- Prevents task-hopping with intention-based logging

## Why This Matters

We all get distracted.  
This tool helps answer the question:  
> *“What was I just doing?”*

By building a real-time log of your activity with smart titles, you're able to:

- Reflect on your work habits
- Stay grounded in what you're doing
- Avoid scattering your attention across apps

## 🛠Tech Stack

- Python / JavaScript backend
- [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api) for natural language task naming
- OS-level window tracking (platform-dependent)
- Optional: Electron/Node integration for GUI or tray app

## Future Features (Ideas)

- Daily task summary / export to calendar
- Idle detection (auto stop/start logging)
- Time tracking per task
- User-defined task categories
